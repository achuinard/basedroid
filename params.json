{"name":"Basedroid","body":"### About\r\nI've found that whenever I want to make an Android app that interacts with some API over JSON, I was rewriting the same boilerplate code every time.  There were also some other pieces of Android boilerplate, such as action bars and state managers, for which I wanted to create a reusable base.  The project also aims to keep Android permissions to a bare minimum - currently it only uses the network request permission.\r\n\r\nThis is Basedroid.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/achuinard/basedroid.git\r\n$ cd basedroid\r\n$ cat README\r\n$ ant clean debug\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Roboguice\r\nBasedroid includes [roboguice](http://code.google.com/p/roboguice/), a dependency injection framework used by popular apps such as Facebook Messenger and Google Docs.\r\n\r\n### BasedroidHttpClient\r\nA singleton HTTP client, wrapped around Apache HttpClient, which provides a simple method to make GET / POST requests.  Examples of deserializing JSON into POJOs (plain old Java objects) are included.\r\n\r\n### StateManager\r\nAnother singleton which allows you to store basic key-value pairs.  I have found that the use of SQLite is unnecessary in apps that I have developed.  The StateManager is wrapped around the Android SharedPreferences class and includes some magic that serializes data into JSON before saving it.\r\n\r\n### Action Bar\r\nBasedroid includes a reusable action bar, a UI pattern now recommended by Google for all Android apps.  You can use the action bar to eliminate the need for the menu button.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nYou will find several examples inside Basedroid - ListViews, asynchronous HTTP requests, state management, and more.\r\n\r\n### Authors and License\r\nBasedroid was developed by Tony Chuinard (@achuinard).
