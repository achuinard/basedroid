Getting Started
------------------------------
1) The Android SDK and Apache Ant, a popular Java build tool, are required.
2) Use the local.properties.example file to create your own local.properties file.
3) The app is built on Android API 2.2.
4) You can list all available Ant tasks through the command 'ant -projecthelp -verbose'.
5) I will create an IntelliJ IDEA project over this,  using the 'existing sources' option when creating the project in IDEA.
