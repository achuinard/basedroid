BASEDROID - A Starting Framework for Android Internet-based Apps
---------
What is Basedroid for?
Basedroid exists to eliminate alot of the Android boilerplate that I've found myself recreating every time I create an Http-based Android app.  It also comes with Roboguice configured (the RoboApplication subclass, libs, etc).


GETTING STARTED WITH BASEDROID
------------------------------

1) Checkout
2) Create a local.properties file
3) Put 'sdk.dir=/my/sdk/dir' in your local.properties file
