Getting Started
------------------------------
1) The Android SDK and Apache Ant, a popular Java build tool, are required.
2) Use the local.properties.example file to create your own local.properties file.
3) You can list all available Ant tasks through the command 'ant -projecthelp -verbose'.
4) Usually I will create an IntelliJ IDEA project over this,  using the 'existing sources' option when creating the project in IDEA.
